# Hi there, I‚Äôm Snehil Kakani! üëã

I‚Äôm a **web developer**, **music producer**, and **actor** with a passion for creative tech, storytelling, and community. By day I build interactive experiences online; by night, I‚Äôm composing beats or stepping into character‚Äîsometimes both at once!

##  About Me
- I specialize in **full-stack web development**, particularly using **Next.js**, **Svelte**, **React**, and **TypeScript**‚Äîamong many other tools :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
- In the creative realm, I produce **hip-hop beats**, play **drums**, **piano**, and **clarinet**, and delve into music production :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
- Outside code and music, I‚Äôm active in **acting**, **sound design**, and **graphic design**‚Äîa blend that makes storytelling multidimensional :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
