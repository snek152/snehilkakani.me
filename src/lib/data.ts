For the past year or so, he has helped me create the webpage for STEMist, dedicating hours each week to fixing bugs and improving the site.  His web development skills have made creating the webpage so much easier, because *I can rely on him* instead of some wacky online website builder.  He transformed the website from a weebly page to what it is today, implementing design requests as soon as I pointed out some error.  *It's been great working with Snehil* both as a friend and as a teamate!",

The contrast between comedy and seriousness in this play created a memorable and educative actor experience for me. I spent many hours in rehearsals, fine-tuning my character, and I was able to develop him significantly. I was also the head of sound once again, and applied all of the lessons I learned from the Laramie Project to this show, in conjunction with training a new sound team to run the show since I was going to be on stage. As I was playing two key roles in this production, it was a great challenge, but nevertheless one I was able to overcome.',

A problem we faced was that our hardware was taken by the school contractors only a few weeks before the show, which meant we had to wait to practice with it. Additionally, this was the first time I had worked on sound design, and due to a lack of foresight I left it until two weeks before the show, but I was able to quickly fix my mistake and put in more time to complete it fast enough. In the end, I was able to once again create a seamless audio experience for the audience, learned about sound design, and am ready to mentor new sound team members in the future.',

Using my audio engineering experience to mix all the actors together and adjust and compress individual frequencies of their voice, I was able to create a seamless and professional audio experience for the audience. The show also brought more attention to the theatre department, which hadn't been recognized in such a way since the pandemic, and I'm glad I got to help with that.",
